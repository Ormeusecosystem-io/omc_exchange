                <p>
                    Money laundering and the financing of terrorism have been identified as risks by ORME (“the Company”).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Legislation derives from the European Union Anti Money Laundering Directives. Individual guidance is provided by each jurisdiction where the Company operates, hence we are obliged to adhere to this guidance. Estonia (‘Est’), as well as many other countries around the world, have passed legislation designed to prevent money laundering and to combat terrorism. This legislation, together with regulations, rules and industry guidance/codes, forms the cornerstone of AML/CFT obligations for license holders and outlines the offences and penalties for failing to comply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this AML Policy is designed to articulate our commitment to detecting, preventing and reporting attempts to use the Exchange to illegally launder money, to finance illegal activities such as terrorism and drug trafficking, or to commit fraud (all activities being "Prohibited Activities").
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any questions relating to this policy should be directed to MLRO@ORME.io.
                <div class="subtitle">2. Policy Statement</div>

                    The Company and its board of directors is committed to full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every officer, director, employee and associated person of the Company is responsible for assisting in the Company's efforts to detect, deter and prevent money laundering and other activities intended to facilitate the funding of terrorism or criminal activities through its services

                <div class="subtitle">7. Reporting: SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTS (SAR)</div>
                <p>
                    The Company is required to report all circumstances where it has knowledge, suspicion or reasonable grounds to suspect that money laundering or the financing of terrorism is being or has taken place or attempted through its facilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Employees are trained in order to recognize suspicious activities and therefore submit SARs where relevant. The MLRO will also make the SARs form available to any employee upon request. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The MLRO is responsible for investigating any internal SAR received and/or any suspicion of ML/TF. The MLRO will acknowledge receipt of any internal SAR received.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When considering a SAR, the MLRO will determine whether or not it needs to be disclosed to the authorities. This includes events in Estonia that may also be reported to other regulators and agencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In making a decision, the MLRO will consider, amongst others:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        the information available regarding the case, i.e.: customer information, documentation, media news; 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        transactions involved;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        account activity inconsistent with the customer’s risk profile; 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            correspondence with the customer;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            the reasons for suspicion, etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                        Based on the above consideration, if the MLRO knows or suspect or has reasonable grounds to know or suspect that money laundering or terrorist financing has taken place, then a disclosure will be made accordingly. In the case the MLRO decides not to make a disclosure, this will be thoroughly documented with the reasons why.
                </p>
                <p>
                        The MLRO will record all internal SARs received by employees in the SAR’s Log. This Log will be kept up to date with any new information that might arise on any given case. 
                </p>
                <div class="subtitle">8. AML/CFT Risk Assessment – Customer Identification (KYC) and Customer Due Diligence</div>
                <p>
                        The Company will perform a risk assessment, at least, on an annual basis. There will be triggers and thresholds in place as part of the assessment.
                </p>
                <p>
                        The risk assessment will be conducted on all customers. If and when necessary, the Company will implement remediation projects in order to deal with any deficiencies which might be identified as part of the Know Your Customer/Customer Due Diligence process.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Customer Due Diligence (“CDD”) is required by law since you can better identify suspicious transactions if you know your customer and understand the reasoning behind their dealings with you. CDD involves a combination of Basic Customer Due Diligence and Enhanced Customer Due Diligence as further explained below.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Know Your Customer (“KYC”) is the process used by the Company to verify the identity of our customers.

                <p>
                        If you acting on behalf of a legal entity, the individual will be required to send us the aforementioned KYC documents with a company stamp and certified as a true copy of the original by a lawyer, certifying officer or a Notary public.

                </p>
                <p>
                        The Company may also disclose any and/or all of the KYC documents to any relevant authority and/or institution in order to examine, inter alia, the customer’s status concerning bankruptcy, reputation checks and criminal records and/or in order to comply with AML laws, regulations, rules or anything related thereto. 
                </p>
                <p>
                        The company also restricts access from certain jurisdictions, type of businesses and certain individuals from becoming our clients and/or consume our services. The AML Policy does not a substitute the customer’s need to comply, in full, with the applicable laws and regulations in connection with their business conduct, personal characteristics and legal status.
 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The company will review and may change this policy, at their discretion, from time to time in compliance with the applicable laws and regulation framework without notice to customers.

                <p>
                        Under no circumstances the Company will, knowingly, engage in a relationship with a person and/or organization appearing in a Sanctions List.
                </p>
