                                    Historically, currency, and fiat money in particular, have been backed by banks and government entities, or backed up by commodities, such as silver or gold. However, Digital Currency is not regulated by any central bank or other government authority. Instead, Digital Currency is backed by technology and trust, and currently, there is no bank or government regulator that can take measures to protect the value of the Digital Currency in a crisis, issue more currency, or balance the price fluctuations.

                                    Digital Currency is based on blockchain technologies, a digital, decentralized and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking, which could collapse at any given moment, and cryptography to maintain its integrity. This system has been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. The functioning of the Website and the Services could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, including, without limitation, the licensing of or restrictions on the use, sale, or possession of digital tokens like the Tokens, which could impede, limit or end the Services or your ability to trade the Digital Currency at any point. Regulatory changes could have negative and material impact that could result in the Digital Currency having little or no value whatsoever.

                                    Digital Currency, when transferred, will be controllable only by the possessor of unique private keys relating to the addresses in which the Digital Currency is held. The theft, loss or destructions of a private key required to access Digital Currency is irreversible, and because the Company does not have access to those private keys, such private keys cannot be restored by the Company, and the Company will not be responsible for Client’s loss of access to its personal virtual wallet. Also, due to the nature of Digital Currency, any technological difficulties experienced by the Company could potentially prevent the access or use of a Client’s Digital Currency.

                                    Certain regulators in certain jurisdictions may view certain types of Digital Currency as securities, and as such, Clients in these jurisdictions may not have the ability to trade their Digital Currency because trading of Digital Currency that is deemed as securities, may be restricted, partially or completely in some jurisdictions. It is your responsibility to ensure your compliance with the applicable laws of your jurisdiction.
