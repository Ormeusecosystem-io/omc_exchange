Your Digital Currency Wallet<\/h2>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<h3>4.1 Purpose of your Digital Currency Wallet<\/h3>\r\n<p>Your Digital Currency Wallet allows you to send supported Digital Currencies to, and to receive and store supported Digital Currencies from, third parties on your instructions, using the Services.<\/p>\r\n<h3>4.2 Supported Digital Currencies<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span>CoinTrader<\/span> currently supports the list of Digital Currencies reflected on our exchange site, accessible <a href=\"\/fees.html\">here<\/a>. However, the nature of the Digital Currencies that <span>CoinTrader<\/span> supports is subject to change, and could change without notice to you if this is required as a result of law, any order of a court of governmental agency, any change to the operating rules in the underlying Digital Currency \u2019s network, or any technological issue outside of our reasonable control.<\/li>\r\n<li><span>CoinTrader<\/span> supports only the \u201cadvanced protocols\u201d reflected on our exchange site, accessible <a href=\"\/trade.html\">here<\/a>.

When making a Digital Currency Deposit, you may need to pay the applicable \u2018miner fee\u2019 (i.e. network fee) to confirm the transaction on the network. To do this, you need to make sure your transaction includes a sufficient miner fee to be confirmed. Insufficient fees will delay the processing of a Transaction. <span>CoinTrader<\/span> may charge miner fees to process a Digital Currency withdrawal on your behalf. If we do so, <span>CoinTrader<\/span> will calculate the miner fee in our discretion and notify you of the amount of the fee at or before the time you authorise the Transaction.<\/p>\r\n<h3>4.4 Operation of your Digital Currency Wallet<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We will send you an email confirmation of all transactions relating to your Digital Currency Wallet. <\/li>\r\n<li><span>CoinTrader<\/span> securely stores all Digital Currency private keys in our control in a combination of online and offline storage. As a result, it may be necessary for <span>CoinTrader<\/span> to retrieve certain information from offline storage in order to facilitate a Digital Currency Transaction in accordance with your instructions. This may delay the initiation or crediting of the relevant Digital Currency Transaction for up to 48 hours, or longer in some circumstances. <\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>4.5 Your confirmations in relation to your Digital Currency Wallet<\/h3>\r\n<p>You confirm that you understand and accept the following:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span>CoinTrader<\/span> will process your Transactions in accordance with your instructions, and you should carefully verify all instructions before placing any Orders. If there is an error in those instructions, then that is your risk and <span>CoinTrader<\/span> does not accept any responsibility or liability.<\/li>\r\n<li>When you transact with another Approved User through the Site (a <strong>Counterparty<\/strong>), there is a risk that the Counterparty may cancel the Transaction before the order is executed.

If you believe a Counterparty has behaved in a misleading or fraudulent manner, or otherwise in breach of these Terms and Conditions, please notify us immediately at <a class=\"support-email\">support@latinblockchain.com<\/a> so that we can determine what action, if any, to take.<\/li>\r\n<li>Your Digital Currency Wallet is available only in connection with the Digital Currencies that <span>CoinTrader<\/span> supports at any time, in its discretion.
