# ShiftMarkets Exchange Widgets

## First time
If this is the first time you initiate the project, you'll have to run either `npm install` or `yarn install` depending on the package manager you have installed in your system.

**Notice** that the project expect **Node v7.7.4** or higher. But its possible that you won't have any problems building from a previous version.

## Build
To build the widgets bundle, run `npm run build` on your terminal.
This will output the following files to the build folder:
- **widgets.min.js**
- **widgets.min.js.map**
- **style.css**

## Current state
You need to manually copy the generated files to the **js** folder of the website.
